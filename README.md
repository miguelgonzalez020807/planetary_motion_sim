# personal_projects
I’m a passionate Year 1 Aerospace Engineering student using this repository to explore maths and physics through self-ideated, code-based projects. I’m especially motivated to model aerodynamic phenomena and build tools that perform calculations and solve engineering problems. Enjoy! :)
